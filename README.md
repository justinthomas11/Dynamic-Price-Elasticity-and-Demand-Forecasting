# Dynamic Price Elasticity and Demand Forecasting

This project explores how customer price sensitivity (elasticity) changes dynamically over time instead of remaining constant. Using the Rossmann retail dataset, the system models regime-dependent demand behavior across promotions, holidays, and competitive environments.

Rather than focusing only on sales prediction, the project introduces dynamic elasticity estimation using rolling features, regime segmentation, and time-aware modeling to capture how demand responds differently under varying market conditions.

The pipeline includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, rolling trend extraction, regime detection, elasticity modeling, and demand forecasting. The goal is to bridge academic research ideas with practical retail pricing intelligence, making the project suitable both for industry use cases and conference publication.

Key Objectives:
- Estimate time-varying price elasticity instead of static coefficients.
- Detect behavioral regimes in retail demand.
- Engineer rolling and lag features for stability and interpretability.
- Forecast demand using regime-aware models.
- Provide actionable insights for pricing and promotion strategies.
